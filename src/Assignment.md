Assignment 1
==============================================================>

The instructions are:

    Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput
    UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs
    Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
    Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
    Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
    Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
    Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
    Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput

Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username

Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets

Assignment --2

 <li>Create an input field (in App component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below it (e.g. in a paragraph).</li>
          <li>Create a new component (=> ValidationComponent) which receives the text length as a prop</li>
          <li>Inside the ValidationComponent, either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the text length (e.g. take 5 as a minimum length)</li>
          <li>Create another component (=> CharComponent) and style it as an inline box (=> display: inline-block, padding: 16px, text-align: center, margin: 16px, border: 1px solid black).</li>
          <li>Render a list of CharComponents where each CharComponent receives a different letter of the entered text (in the initial input field) as a prop.</li>
          <li>When you click a CharComponent, it should be removed from the entered text.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Hint: Keep in mind that JavaScript strings are basically arrays!</p>
